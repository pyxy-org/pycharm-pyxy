# PyxyCharm

<!-- Plugin description -->
Pyxy support for PyCharm
<!-- Plugin description end -->

This is currently under development. Most of the basic functionality is implemented.

## TODO

* [ ] Fix highlighting for brace expressions in attribute values
* [ ] Why does PyCharm see `<div />` as `Any` instead of `Element`? I think this is a regression from an earlier version.
* [ ] Highlight matching tag pairs
* [ ] Colorize nested tags (like is done for HTML files)
