## TODO

* [ ] Fix bug on hyphenated tag names
  * Partially fixed, need to figure out how to handle tag names which aren't valid identifiers (due to containing a hyphen, colon, or otherwise)
* [ ] Validate closing tag name
* [ ] Highlight matching tag pairs
* [ ] Colorize nested tags (like is done for HTML files)
